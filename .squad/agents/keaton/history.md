# Project Context

- **Owner:** Brady
- **Project:** squad-sdk — the programmable multi-agent runtime for GitHub Copilot (v1 replatform)
- **Stack:** TypeScript (strict mode, ESM-only), Node.js ≥20, @github/copilot-sdk, Vitest, esbuild
- **Created:** 2026-02-21

## Learnings

### 2026-02-24: Documentation Restructure Plan (requested by Brady)
- **Task:** Design a new documentation structure. Current 85 pages (62 non-blog) are overwhelming. Brady wants fewer, better docs that make Squad look simple and appealing.
- **Analysis:** Read all key docs — guide/, features/ (25 files), scenarios/ (21 files), cli/, sdk/, reference/. Understood content depth, overlap, and gaps.
- **Proposal delivered:** Cut 62 non-blog pages to 18 (71% reduction). Blog (23 posts) untouched. Total: 41 pages.
- **Structure:** Home (pitch) → Get Started (install + first session hero) → Concepts (5 themed pages consolidating all 25 features) → Scenarios (6 curated from 21) → Reference (CLI + SDK, one page each) → Cookbook (advanced recipes + migration/troubleshooting)
- **Key decisions:**
  - All 25 feature docs merge into 5 concept pages: Your Team, Memory & Knowledge, Parallel Work & Models, GitHub Integration, Portability & Extensions
  - 6 scenarios curated as standalone: existing-repo, solo-dev, issue-driven-dev, monorepo, ci-cd, team-of-humans
  - 15 remaining scenarios become compact recipes in cookbook
  - First Session is the hero doc — leads with the "wow moment"
  - Home page is a pitch, not a table of contents
- **Proposal location:** Session state file `docs-restructure-plan.md`
- **Status:** Awaiting Brady's approval before execution
- **Next step:** If approved, assign merge work to agents (5 concept pages are biggest effort, ~2-3 hours each)

### 2026-02-23: Docs Site Engine & Beta Content (#185, #188)
- **Task:** Build a minimal static site generator for markdown documentation + landing page with navigation sidebar
- **Solution delivered:**
  - `docs/build.js` — ESM-compatible Node.js markdown-to-HTML converter (uses file:// URLs for imports)
  - `docs/template.html` — HTML5 template with sticky sidebar navigation, responsive design, mobile hamburger menu
  - `docs/assets/style.css` — Professional GitHub-styled design (CSS variables, flexbox layout, dark sidebar, syntax highlighting for code blocks)
  - `docs/assets/app.js` — Minimal JavaScript (sidebar toggle on mobile, active page highlighting, click-to-close)
  - `docs/guide/index.md` — Landing page linking all guides with organized sections (Getting Started, Guides, Reference)
- **Content verified:** All 8 existing guides present (installation, configuration, shell, sdk-integration, tools-and-hooks, marketplace, upstream-inheritance, feature-migration) + architecture/api reference
- **Build system:** Running `node docs/build.js` generates HTML in `docs/dist/` (added to .gitignore explicitly)
- **Key decision:** ESM-only approach (project-wide constraint) required `import.meta.url` + `fileURLToPath` for __dirname replacement
- **GitHub Pages ready:** Output is static HTML with relative asset paths, works offline
- **Status:** ✅ All 10 HTML files generated successfully with no errors

### 2026-02-22: Issue #306 Cleanup Audit (Phase 1 — AUDIT ONLY)
- **Scope:** Comprehensive audit of hardcoded values, code quality, and test coverage gaps across `packages/squad-sdk/src/` and `packages/squad-cli/src/`
- **Findings:** 47 total findings across 4 categories:
  - **Hardcoded Logic (18):** Model names duplicated in 6 files with no single source of truth; default model conflicts (haiku vs. sonnet); timeouts hard-coded with no env var overrides; agent roles not config-driven; OTLP endpoint localhost assumption
  - **Code Quality (16):** CRITICAL command injection (CWE-78) in upstream.ts ×3 occurrences (execSync with template string interpolation); error handling inconsistency (fatal() vs error() semantic clash); TODO markers in spawn.ts blocking full shell integration
  - **Test Coverage (8):** HealthMonitor untested; ModelFallbackExecutor cross-tier rules untested; upstream git clone not exercised in tests; watch.ts GitHub triage logic untested; shell integration end-to-end untested
  - **Empathy/UX (5):** Generic error messages (no context for GitHub vs. config failures); hardcoded timeouts affect slow networks; quiet CLI failures; no debug logging
- **Critical Issue:** Command injection in upstream.ts: `execSync(\`git clone ... --branch ${ref}\`...)`  allows shell metacharacter injection if ref or cloneDir naming is attacker-controlled
- **Architecture Pattern:** All hardcoded values should be extracted to `constants.ts` with environment variable overrides (cost, deployment flexibility)
- **Recommended Sequencing:** Phase 1 (Security & Stability): CWE-78 fix. Phase 2 (Configuration Extraction): Centralize models, timeouts, roles. Phase 3 (Test Coverage): HealthMonitor, fallback executor, shell integration. Phase 4 (UX): Error messages, DEBUG logging.
- **Agent Assignment Recommendations:** Fenster (upstream.ts fix + tests), Edie (config extraction), Hockney (test coverage), Baer (error messages/UX)
- **Report Location:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/keaton-cleanup-audit.md`
- **Next Step:** Brady/Keaton review, assign specific tasks to agents, create GitHub issues for each finding

### From Beta (carried forward)
- Architecture patterns that compound — decisions that make future features easier
- Silent success mitigation lessons: ~7-10% of background spawns return no text, mitigated by RESPONSE ORDER block + filesystem checks
- Reviewer rejection lockout enforcement: if Keaton/Hockney/Baer rejects, original author is locked out
- Proposal-first workflow: docs/proposals/ before execution for meaningful changes
- 13 modules: adapter, agents, build, casting, cli, client, config, coordinator, hooks, marketplace, ralph, runtime, sharing, skills, tools
- Distribution: GitHub-native (npx github:bradygaster/squad), never npmjs.com
- v1 docs are internal only — no published docs site

### 2026-02-21: Interactive Shell Proposal
- **Problem:** Copilot CLI dependency creates unreliable handoffs, zero agent visibility, and external UX control

### 📌 Team update (2026-02-22T10:03Z): PR #300 review completed (architecture, security, code, tests) — REQUEST CHANGES verdict with 4 blockers — decided by Keaton
- **Solution:** Squad becomes its own REPL/shell — users launch `squad` with no args, enter interactive session
- **Architecture decision:** Copilot SDK as LLM backend (streaming, tool dispatch), Squad owns spawning + coordination UX
- **Terminal UI:** Recommend `ink` (React for CLIs) — battle-tested, component model, testable, cross-platform
- **No breaking changes:** All subcommands (init, watch, export) unchanged; squad.agent.md still works for Copilot-native users
- **Wave restructure:** This becomes Wave 0 (foundation) — blocks distribution (Wave 1), SquadUI (Wave 2), docs (Wave 3)
- **Key decisions needed:** ink vs. alternatives, session-per-agent vs. pooling, background cleanup strategy
- **File paths:** docs/proposals/squad-interactive-shell.md (proposal), GitHub issue #232 (epic tracking)
- **Pattern:** When product direction shifts, invalidate existing wave structure and rebuild from foundation

### 2026-02-21: SDK/CLI Split Architecture Decision
- **Problem:** All 114 .ts files live in root `src/`. Workspace packages `squad-sdk` and `squad-cli` are published stubs. Need to move real code into them.
- **Analysis:** Dependency flow is strictly CLI → SDK → @github/copilot-sdk. No circular deps. No SDK module imports from CLI. Clean DAG.
- **Architecture decision:** SDK gets 15 directories + 4 standalone files (adapter, agents, build, casting, client, config, coordinator, hooks, marketplace, ralph, runtime, sharing, skills, tools, utils, index.ts, resolution.ts, parsers.ts, types.ts). CLI gets `src/cli/` + `src/cli-entry.ts`. Root becomes workspace orchestrator only.
- **Key call:** Remove CLI utility re-exports (`success`, `error`, `fatal`, `runInit`, etc.) from SDK barrel. These leaked CLI implementation into the library surface. Breaking change — correct and intentional.
- **Key call:** `ink` and `react` are CLI-only deps. SDK has zero UI dependencies.
- **Migration order:** SDK first (CLI depends on it), CLI second (rewrite imports to package names), root cleanup third.
- **Exports map:** SDK subpath exports expand from 7 to 18 entries — every module independently importable.
- **File path:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/keaton-sdk-cli-split-plan.md`
- **Pattern:** One-way dependency graphs enable independent package evolution. SDK stays pure library; CLI stays thin consumer.

### 📌 Team update (2026-02-22T041800Z): SDK/CLI split plan executed, versions aligned to 0.8.0, 1719 tests passing
Keaton's split plan produced definitive SDK/CLI mapping with clean DAG (CLI → SDK → @github/copilot-sdk). Fenster migrated 154 files across both packages. Edie fixed all 6 config files (tsconfigs with composite builds, package.json exports maps). Kobayashi aligned all versions to 0.8.0 (clear break from 0.7.0 stubs). Hockney verified build clean + all 1719 tests pass, deferred test import migration until root src/ removal. Rabin verified publish workflows ready. Coordinator published both packages to npm (0.8.0). Inbox merged to decisions.md. Ready for Phase 3 (root cleanup).

## Status Snapshot (2026-02-22T225951Z)

**Current Branch:** `bradygaster/dev` (latest: d2b1b1f)  
**No Open PRs** — Previous work is merged. Repository is in a clean state.

### What's Shipped ✅
- **Root package:** v0.6.0-alpha.0 (workspace coordinator, private)
- **SDK package:** v0.8.0 (real code, 18 subpath exports, @github/copilot-sdk only)
- **CLI package:** v0.8.1 (ink/react shell foundation, parser functions, agent spawn skeleton)
- **Build:** ✅ Clean (SDK + CLI both compile with zero errors)
- **Tests:** ✅ 1,727 passing across 57 test files
- **Architecture:** ✅ SDK/CLI split complete, one-way dependency graph (CLI → SDK → Copilot SDK)

### What's Missing / Incomplete ⚠️
1. **Root src/ directory removal** — Still exists alongside workspace packages. Phase 3 cleanup is blocked. This creates confusion about canonical source location.
2. **Interactive shell UX implementation** — `runShell()` is console.log-only. Ink component wiring not done (AgentPanel.tsx, MessageStream.tsx defined but not integrated). Session/prompt/spawn all stubbed.
3. **OpenTelemetry observability epic** — 9 P0/P1 issues (#261, #257–259, etc.): token metrics, agent/coordinator tracing, session pool metrics. None in progress.
4. **Documentation migration epic** — 11 issues (#182–206): copy beta docs, update URLs, write new guides (Architecture, Migration, SDK API Reference). High priority but no active work.
5. **Test import migration** — 150+ import lines still use `../src/` (root); blocked until root deletion.

### Open Issues Summary (27 open, 6 assigned to Keaton)
- **Observability (9):** Epic #253 — Token usage metrics (P0), agent lifecycle traces (P0/P1), session pool metrics, Aspire dashboard integration
- **Docs (11):** Epic #182 — Migration guide, API reference, architecture overview, install guides (all Keaton)
- **File watcher:** #268 (Fenster, P1) — Port squad-observer from paulyuk/squad
- **OTel integration tests:** #267 (Hockney, P1)
- **SquadUI integration:** 2 issues in pipeline

### Critical Blockers ⛔
**None for current release.** But two near-term constraints:
1. **Root src/ is a time bomb** — Parallel structure (root src/ + workspace packages) is confusing and error-prone. Removing it unblocks test migration and clarifies package boundaries.
2. **Observability is a pre-requisite for production** — All 9 OTel issues are P0/P1, needed before a public release. Token metrics (#261) is marked P0 (release blocker).

### Recommended Next Steps (Prioritized)
1. **Phase 3: Delete root src/ directory** — Move remaining 56 test files to use workspace packages. Unblock test import migration. Forces clarity.
2. **Merge missing observability** — Assign OTel work (9 issues) to sprint. #261 (token metrics) is P0. Others are P1 (agent/coordinator traces). Needed for production observability.
3. **Documentation pass** — Assign 11-issue epic to Keaton (already labeled). Write Architecture Overview (#206), Migration Guide (#203), API Reference (#196). Unblock public release.
4. **Complete interactive shell wiring** — Wire Ink components (AgentPanel, MessageStream, InputPrompt) to SDK session → streaming. Current code is skeleton-only.
5. **Verify insider publish pipeline** — Both packages published to npm (0.8.0 insider). Run end-to-end test: `npm install -g @bradygaster/squad-cli && squad` on a fresh machine.

### 2026-02-22: Upstream Inheritance PR Review (PR #300)
- **Author:** Tamir Dresher (tamirdresher)
- **Verdict:** Request Changes (4 blocking items)
- **Architecture:** Org → Team → Repo hierarchy is sound. Closest-wins conflict resolution is the right default. SDK/CLI split follows established patterns. `.squad/upstream.json` is correct config location.
- **Blocking issues:** (1) No proposal document — violates proposal-first workflow, (2) `Record<string, unknown>` for castingPolicy — violates strict typing decision, (3) No sanitization on inherited content — security gap vs. existing export sanitization, (4) `.ai-team/` fallback in `findSquadDir()` — undocumented dual-format support.
- **Non-blocking concerns:** No coordinator integration wired yet (dead library code without it), live local upstreams create silent coupling (asymmetric with git sync), `export` upstream type relationship with sharing module's `ExportBundle` is unclear.
- **Pattern learned:** External contributors may not know about proposal-first workflow — add to CONTRIBUTING.md or PR template.
- **Decision file:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/keaton-upstream-review.md`

### 2026-02-24: GitHub Pages Publishing Architecture (requested by Brady)
- **Research scope:** Compare old repo (bradygaster/squad) GH Pages setup with current squad-pr, identify simplest path forward.
- **Old repo findings:** 
  - `squad-docs.yml` workflow on `preview` branch, runs on push to docs/** or workflow_dispatch.
  - Uses `markdown-it` + `markdown-it-anchor` npm deps (8-10KB footprint).
  - Calls `node docs/build.js --out _site --base /squad` (old repo deployed to subpath).
  - Uses standard GH Pages Actions: `upload-pages-artifact` + `deploy-pages`.
  - Docs structure: Root markdown files (guide.md, whatsnew.md, insider-program.md) + subdirs (blog/, features/, scenarios/, specs/, migration/).
  - Has blog support with frontmatter parsing (title, date extraction).
- **Current repo status:**
  - **Already has:** `squad-docs.yml` workflow (identical to old repo).
  - **Already has:** `docs/build.js` — ESM version, simpler markdown-to-HTML regex-based converter (no npm deps).
  - **Already has:** `docs/template.html`, `docs/assets/style.css`, `docs/assets/app.js`.
  - **Already has:** `docs/guide/` with 8 markdown guides (installation, configuration, shell, sdk-integration, tools-and-hooks, marketplace, upstream-inheritance, feature-migration).
  - **Content vs. structure mismatch:** Current build.js doesn't support subdirectories (blog/, features/) like old repo does — it's single-layer navigation.
- **Recommendation (TL;DR):**
  1. **Keep the existing workflow.** `squad-docs.yml` is already correct for GH Pages (GitHub Actions native, no third-party tools).
  2. **Use our own build.js — it's perfect.** No npm deps, lightweight, ESM-native (matches project constraint), already tested, generates relative-path HTML.
  3. **Ship docs immediately:** Current setup is production-ready. Run `node docs/build.js` locally, output goes to `docs/dist/` (gitignored), workflow pushes to GH Pages.
  4. **Blog support (future wave):** Old repo uses `markdown-it` for features like frontmatter + anchors. If blog posts needed, either: (a) extend our build.js with frontmatter parsing (15 lines), or (b) add markdown-it as optional dep.
  5. **Deployment target:** Squad should publish to `https://bradygaster.github.io/squad-pr/` (subpath /squad-pr). Update `--base /squad-pr` in workflow if needed.
  6. **Why not adopt old approach verbatim:** Old repo's markdown-it is heavier, pulls npm deps into docs build. Our regex-based converter is lean and sufficient for guides. Only adopt markdown-it if frontmatter/fancy features are required.
- **Next steps (Brady):** (1) Verify .gitignore has `docs/dist/`, (2) Test `node docs/build.js` locally, (3) Push to preview branch, (4) Enable GH Pages in repo settings (deploy from Actions), (5) Post-launch: Plan blog support if needed.
- **Decision file:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/keaton-gh-pages.md`
