## Core Context

**Created:** 2026-02-21  
**Role:** Core Developer — Runtime implementation, CLI structure, shell infrastructure  
**Key Decisions Owned:** Test import patterns (vitest via dist/), CRLF normalization at parser entry, shell module structure (readline→ink progression), spawn lifecycle, SessionRegistry design

**Phase 1-2 Complete (2026-02-21 → 2026-02-22T041800Z):**
- M3 Resolution (#210/#211): `resolveSquad()` + `resolveGlobalSquadPath()` in src/resolution.ts, standalone concerns (no auto-fallback)
- CLI: --global flag routing, `squad status` command composition, command rename finalized (triage, loop, hire)
- Shell foundation: readline-based CLI shell, SessionRegistry (Map-backed, no persistence), spawn infrastructure (loadAgentCharter, buildAgentPrompt, spawnAgent)
- CRLF hardening: normalize-eol.ts applied to 8 parsers, one-line guard at entry point
- SDK/CLI split executed: 15 dirs + 4 files migrated to packages/, exports map updated (7→18 subpaths SDK, 14 subpaths CLI), 6 config files fixed, versions aligned to 0.8.0
- Test import migration: 56 test files migrated from ../src/ to @bradygaster/squad-sdk/* and @bradygaster/squad-cli/*, 26 SDK + 16 CLI subpath exports, vitest resolves via dist/, all 1719+ tests passing

### 📌 Team update (2026-02-22T10:03Z): PR #300 architecture review completed — REQUEST CHANGES verdict with 4 blockers (proposal doc, type safety on castingPolicy, missing sanitization, ambiguous .ai-team/ fallback) — decided by Keaton
- Zero-dependency scaffolding preserved, strict mode enforced, build clean (tsc 0 errors)

**Phase 3 Blocking (2026-02-22 onwards):**
- Ralph start(): EventBus subscription + health checks (14 TODOs)
- Coordinator initialize()/route(): CopilotClient wiring + agent manager (13 TODOs)
- Agents spawn(): SDK session creation + history injection (14 TODOs)
- Shell UI: Ink components not yet wired (readline only), streaming responses, agent status display
- Casting: registry.json parsing stub (1 TODO)
- Triage/Loop/Hire: placeholder commands (low priority, defer)

## 2026-03-02: Squad Aspire Timeline & Deprecation Archaeology

**Requested by:** Brady. "What happened to squad aspire? When did we deprecate it, and why?"

**Task:** Complete git archaeology — all commits, PRs, issues, branches, deprecation markers, blog posts.

**Findings:**

**Timeline:**
- **2026-02-22 (~c1d5c7c→992763e):** Feature introduced. PR #265 added `squad aspire` command (Issue #265) as the CLI entry point to launch .NET Aspire dashboard for Squad observability. Core file: `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/commands/aspire.ts` (175 lines).
- **2026-02-22 (PR #307):** OTel Phase 4 consolidation — aspire command + file watcher + event payloads merged.
- **2026-02-22 (PR #309):** Wave 2 merge added Aspire Playwright E2E tests, validating aspire.ts as a tested feature.
- **2026-02-25 onwards:** Multiple PRs (PR #539, #540, #546, #533) reference aspire in docs + help text — still treated as stable command.
- **Latest commit (c1d5c7c, Mar 2026):** `fix: make sendAndWait timeout configurable (#347)` — aspire tests still passing.

**Deprecation Status:**
- ❌ **NO git commits mentioning removal/deprecation** — searched `--all-match --grep="remove.*aspire|aspire.*remove|deprecat.*aspire|aspire.*deprecat"` — zero results.
- ❌ **NO GitHub issues labeled "aspire" requesting removal** — all open/closed issues show aspire as stable, documented feature.
- ❌ **NO GitHub PRs with deprecation plan** — PR #265 (aspire intro), PR #307 (OTel Phase 4), PR #309 (Wave 2) all finalize aspire as shipped feature.
- ❌ **NO deprecation markers in code** — aspire.ts has no @deprecated JSDoc, no console.warn(), no alpha/beta flag.
- ❌ **NO "planned removal" documentation** — docs/scenarios/aspire-dashboard.md (full guide, no sunset date), blog post 014-wave-1-otel-and-aspire.md (celebrates it as Wave 1 feature).

**Current Status:**
- ✅ **Fully wired:** Command routing at cli-entry.ts:822-829, help text at lines 396-416.
- ✅ **Documented:** Help text ("Launch Aspire Dashboard"), per-command help, scenario docs, blog post.
- ✅ **Tested:** Three test suites (aspire-command.test.ts, aspire-integration.test.ts, cli/aspire.test.ts) with passing tests.
- ✅ **Active:** Latest commit (Mar 2) touches related test infrastructure; aspire command is a dependency for observability workflows.

**Conclusion:** Squad aspire was **NEVER deprecated**. It is an actively maintained observability feature that shipped in Wave 1 (Feb 2026) and remains current and documented as of Mar 2026.

**Key Learning:** Aspire is not a transient feature or experiment—it's a core observability tool for multi-agent debugging. Wave 1 established it as stable; Wave 2 validated it with E2E tests. It's part of the "watching agents work" story alongside EventBus, OTel metrics, and SquadObserver.

### Connection promise dedup in SquadClient (2026-03-02)

**Task:** Fix race condition where concurrent `connect()` calls (eager warm-up + auto-cast) crash with "Connection already in progress" during `squad init "..."` with empty roster.

**Root cause:** `connect()` threw when `state === "connecting"` instead of letting callers share the in-flight connection promise.

**Fix:** Added `connectPromise: Promise<void> | null` field to `SquadClient`. When `connect()` is called and a connection is already in progress, it returns the existing promise instead of throwing. The promise is cleared on completion (success or failure), and also cleared in `disconnect()` / `forceDisconnect()`.

**Key decisions:**
- Promise dedup pattern: store the connection promise, return it to concurrent callers
- Span lifecycle: error status set inside the IIFE before `span.end()`, not in an outer catch after end
- `connectPromise` cleared in `disconnect()` and `forceDisconnect()` for clean state reset

**Files modified:** `packages/squad-sdk/src/adapter/client.ts`
**Verified:** Build clean (SDK + CLI).

### 📌 Team update (2026-03-01T20-24-57Z): CLI UI Polish PRD finalized — 20 issues created, team routing established
- **Status:** Completed — Parallel spawn of Redfoot (Design), Marquez (UX), Cheritto (TUI), Kovash (REPL), Keaton (Lead) for image review synthesis
- **Outcome:** Pragmatic alpha-first strategy adopted — fix P0 blockers + P1 quick wins, defer grand redesign to post-alpha
- **PRD location:** docs/prd-cli-ui-polish.md (authoritative reference for alpha-1 release)
- **Issues created:** GitHub #662–681 (20 discrete issues with priorities P0/P1/P2/P3, effort estimates, team routing)
- **Key decisions merged:**
  - Fenster: Cast confirmation required for freeform REPL casts
  - Kovash: ShellApi.setProcessing() exposed to prevent spinner bugs in async paths
  - Brady: Alpha shipment acceptable, experimental banner required, rotating spinner messages (every ~3s)
- **Timeline:** P0 (1-2 days) → P1 (2-3 days) → P2 (1 week) — alpha ship when P0+P1 complete
- **Session log:** .squad/log/2026-03-01T20-13-00Z-ui-polish-prd.md
- **Decision files merged to decisions.md:** keaton-prd-ui-polish.md, fenster-cast-confirmation-ux.md, kovash-processing-spinner.md, copilot directives

### 📌 PR #547 Review (2026-03-01) — External Contributor — Fenster
**Requested by:** Brady. Review "Squad Remote Control - PTY mirror + devtunnel for phone access" from tamirdresher.

**What It Does:**
- Adds `squad start --tunnel` command to run Copilot in a PTY and mirror terminal output over WebSocket + devtunnel
- Adds RemoteBridge (WebSocket server) that streams terminal sessions to a PWA (xterm.js) on phone/browser
- Uses Microsoft Dev Tunnels for authenticated relay (zero infrastructure)
- Bidirectional: phone keyboard input goes to Copilot stdin
- Session management dashboard (list/delete tunnels via `devtunnel list`)
- 18 tests (all failing due to export issues)

**Architecture:**
- **CLI commands:** `start.ts` (PTY+tunnel orchestration), `rc.ts` (bridge-only mode), `rc-tunnel.ts` (devtunnel lifecycle)
- **SDK bridge:** `packages/squad-sdk/src/remote/bridge.ts` (RemoteBridge class, WebSocket server, HTTP server, static file serving, sessions API)
- **Protocol:** `protocol.ts` (event serialization), `types.ts` (config types)
- **PWA UI:** `remote-ui/` (index.html, app.js, styles.css, manifest.json) — xterm.js terminal + session dashboard
- **Integration:** New `start` command in `cli-entry.ts` (lines 230-242)

**Dependencies Added:**
- `node-pty@1.1.0` — PTY for terminal mirroring (native addon, requires node-gyp)
- `ws@8.19.0` — WebSocket server (both CLI and SDK)
- `qrcode-terminal@0.12.0` — QR code display in terminal
- `@types/ws@8.18.1` (dev)

**Critical Issues — MUST FIX BEFORE MERGE:**

1. **Build broken (TypeScript errors):**
   - `start.ts:117` — Cannot find module 'node-pty' (missing in tsconfig paths or needs `@types/node-pty`)
   - `start.ts:177` — Binding element 'exitCode' implicitly has 'any' type (needs explicit type on `pty.onExit` callback)
   - **All 18 tests fail** due to RemoteBridge/protocol functions not being exported properly from SDK

2. **Security — Command Injection Risk (HIGH):**
   - `rc-tunnel.ts:47-49` — Uses `execFileSync` with string interpolation in `--labels` args. If `repo`, `branch`, or `machine` contain shell metacharacters, this is CWE-78. **MUST** pass label values as separate array elements without string interpolation.
   - `rc-tunnel.ts:62-64` — Same issue in `port create` command.
   - **Pattern violation:** Baer's decision (decisions.md) mandates `execFileSync` with array args, no string interpolation.

3. **Security — Environment Variable Blocklist (start.ts:135-148):**
   - Good defense-in-depth pattern (blocks `NODE_OPTIONS`, `LD_PRELOAD`, etc.) but **incomplete**.
   - Missing `PATH` restriction — allows PATH hijacking to inject malicious binaries.
   - Missing `HOME`/`USERPROFILE` restriction — allows access to dotfiles with secrets.
   - **Recommendation:** Explicitly allow-list safe vars (`TERM`, `LANG`, `TZ`, `COLORTERM`) instead of block-list. Current approach is fragile.

4. **Security — Hardcoded Path Assumption (Windows-only):**
   - `start.ts:119-122` and `rc.ts:184-188` — Hardcoded path `C:\ProgramData\global-npm\node_modules\@github\copilot\node_modules\@github\copilot-win32-x64\copilot.exe`.
   - This breaks on macOS/Linux (no fallback logic shown).
   - Cross-platform pattern should use `which copilot` or check `process.platform` and resolve from npm global dir programmatically.

5. **Rate Limiting — Weak HTTP Protection:**
   - `bridge.ts:94-106` — HTTP rate limit is 30 req/min per IP. WebSocket has per-connection limit but no global connection limit per IP.
   - **Attack vector:** Attacker can open 1000 WebSocket connections (each under rate limit) and DoS the bridge.
   - **Fix:** Add global connection limit per IP (e.g., max 3 concurrent WS connections per IP).

6. **Session Token Exposure:**
   - `start.ts:97-98` — Session token is appended to tunnel URL as query param and displayed in QR code + terminal output.
   - This token is logged to terminal history, potentially visible in screenshots, and sent over tunnel URL (visible in proxy logs).
   - **Better pattern:** Use the ticket exchange endpoint (`/api/auth/ticket`) instead — client POSTs token to get one-time ticket, uses ticket for WS connection.
   - **Why it matters:** Token has 4-hour TTL, ticket has 1-minute TTL. Reduces window for replay attacks.

7. **Audit Log Location:**
   - `bridge.ts:43` — Audit log goes to `~/.cli-tunnel/audit/`. This is not in `.squad/` directory.
   - **Inconsistency:** All Squad state is in `.squad/` (decisions.md), but audit logs are elsewhere.
   - **Recommendation:** Use `.squad/log/remote-audit-{timestamp}.jsonl` for consistency.

8. **Secret Redaction — Missing JWT Detection:**
   - `bridge.ts:377-393` — `redactSecrets()` has patterns for GitHub tokens, AWS keys, Bearer tokens, JWTs.
   - BUT: JWT regex `/eyJ.../` only matches base64 tokens. Doesn't catch Bearer-wrapped JWTs (`Bearer eyJ...`).
   - **Fix:** Combine patterns — check for `Bearer eyJ...` before stripping Bearer header.

9. **File Serving — Directory Traversal (Mitigated but Fragile):**
   - `start.ts:63-74` and `rc.ts:118-142` — Both implement directory traversal guards (`!filePath.startsWith(uiDir)`).
   - **Good:** Uses `path.resolve()` and prefix check.
   - **Fragile:** Relies on manual sanitization in multiple places. If one handler is added later without this pattern, vulnerability reintroduced.
   - **Recommendation:** Extract to shared `serveStaticFile(uiDir, req, res)` helper in SDK to enforce pattern.

10. **Test Failures — Export Configuration Broken:**
    - All 18 tests fail with "RemoteBridge is not a constructor" and "serializeEvent is not a function".
    - Root cause: `packages/squad-sdk/src/remote/index.ts` exports `RemoteBridge` from `./bridge.js` but `bridge.ts` may not be built or exported correctly.
    - **Build error** (from `npm run build`): TypeScript errors in `start.ts` block CLI build, so SDK may not have rebuilt.
    - **Fix:** Resolve TypeScript errors, rebuild SDK, verify tests pass.

**Non-Critical Issues:**

11. **node-pty Native Dependency:**
    - Requires node-gyp + C++ compiler on install. Will break in CI or Docker if build tools not installed.
    - **Mitigation:** Document in PR that `node-pty` requires native build, or consider optional dependency with graceful fallback.

12. **Windows-Centric Implementation:**
    - Most code assumes Windows (`C:\`, PowerShell paths, devtunnel CLI).
    - macOS/Linux support unclear. If intended as Windows-only, document clearly.

13. **Devtunnel Dependency:**
    - Requires `devtunnel` CLI installed + authenticated (`devtunnel user login`).
    - Not bundled, not auto-installed. User must manually install via `winget` or download.
    - **UX:** Should have better error message when devtunnel missing (currently just "⚠ devtunnel not installed" without link to install instructions).

14. **Passthrough Mode vs. PTY Mode:**
    - `rc.ts` spawns `copilot --acp` and pipes JSON-RPC (passthrough mode).
    - `start.ts` spawns Copilot in PTY and sends raw terminal bytes (PTY mode).
    - Two separate code paths for essentially the same feature. **Why not unify?**
    - If PTY mode is better (full TUI experience), deprecate `rc.ts`. If ACP passthrough is needed for API access, document the use case split.

**Integration with Existing CLI:**
- ✅ Command routing in `cli-entry.ts` follows existing pattern (dynamic import, options parsing)
- ✅ Help text added (lines 65-69)
- ✅ Flag passthrough works (`--yolo`, `--model`, etc. passed to Copilot)
- ❌ No integration with existing squad commands (`squad status`, `squad loop`, etc.) — isolated feature
- ❌ No integration with EventBus or Coordinator — doesn't participate in Squad agent orchestration

**Recommendation:**
- **DO NOT MERGE** until critical issues fixed (build errors, command injection, test failures).
- **After fixes:** This is a cool demo feature but needs architectural discussion:
  1. Is remote access in scope for Squad v1? (Not in any PRD I've seen.)
  2. Should this be a plugin or core feature?
  3. Native dependency (node-pty) adds install complexity — is that acceptable?
  4. Windows-only (effectively) — acceptable?
  5. Devtunnel dependency — acceptable external requirement?

**If Brady approves the concept:**
- Merge only after all security issues fixed + tests passing + cross-platform support clarified.
- Document clearly: experimental feature, Windows-only (if true), requires devtunnel CLI.
- Consider renaming `start` command to `squad remote` or `squad tunnel` to avoid confusion with future `squad start` (which might mean "start the squad daemon").

**Decision File Needed:**
- This introduces a new CLI command paradigm (interactive terminal mirroring vs. agent orchestration). Needs a decision: "Remote access via devtunnel is Squad's mobile UX strategy" or "This is an experimental plugin".


### 📌 Multi-Squad Phase 1: Core SDK + Config + Migration (PR #691, Issue #652)
**Requested by:** Brady. Implement foundational layer for multiple personal squads.

**What was built:**
- New module: `packages/squad-sdk/src/multi-squad.ts` — 7 exported functions + 3 types
- `getSquadRoot()` delegates to existing `resolveGlobalSquadPath()` for platform detection
- `resolveSquadPath(name?)` implements 5-step resolution chain: explicit → env → config → default → legacy
- `listSquads()`, `createSquad()`, `deleteSquad()`, `switchSquad()` — full CRUD for squad registry
- `migrateIfNeeded()` — non-destructive: registers legacy `~/.squad` as "default" in `squads.json`, never moves files
- Types `SquadEntry`, `MultiSquadConfig`, `SquadInfo` exported from SDK barrel + types.ts
- squads.json lives at global config root (`%APPDATA%/squad/` on Windows, `~/.config/squad/` on Linux)

**Key design choices:**
- Migration is registration-only. Files stay where they are. This avoids data loss risk on first upgrade.
- `deleteSquad()` blocks deletion of the active squad (safety valve).
- `resolveSquadPath()` calls `migrateIfNeeded()` on every invocation — idempotent, returns fast after first run.
- Re-used `resolveGlobalSquadPath()` from resolution.ts rather than duplicating platform logic.

**What's NOT included (Phase 2):**
- No CLI commands (`squad list`, `squad create`, `squad switch`, etc.)
- No changes to CLI entry point or existing resolution chain

**Verification:** tsc --noEmit clean. vitest run: 3217 passed, 126 failed (all pre-existing).

## 2025-07: cli.js shim replacement

**Task:** Replace the stale ~2000-line bundled `cli.js` with a thin ESM shim that forwards to the built CLI at `packages/squad-cli/dist/cli-entry.js`.

**What changed:**
- `cli.js` reduced from 1982 lines to 14 lines
- Shim imports `./packages/squad-cli/dist/cli-entry.js` which auto-executes `main()`
- Deprecation notice only shows when invoked via npm/npx (checks `process.env.npm_execpath`), silent for `node cli.js`

**Why:** The bundled cli.js was from the old GitHub-native distribution and was missing commands added after the monorepo migration (e.g., `aspire`). Running `node cli.js aspire` failed. Now it forwards to the real CLI entry point.

**Verification:** `node cli.js aspire --help` works. `node cli.js help` shows all commands. Test suite: 3333 passed, 10 failed (all pre-existing).

## Learnings

- Root package.json has `"type": "module"` — bare `import` works in cli.js (no dynamic import needed)
- `packages/squad-cli/dist/cli-entry.js` auto-executes `main().catch(...)` at module level — importing it is sufficient to run the CLI
- `process.env.npm_execpath` is set when running via npm/npx but absent for direct `node` invocation — good signal for conditional deprecation notices

## 2025-07: Knock-Knock Multi-Agent Sample

**Requested by:** Brady. Create the simplest possible multi-agent sample: two agents trading knock-knock jokes in Docker, demonstrating Squad SDK patterns without requiring Copilot auth.

**What was built:** `samples/knock-knock/` — 6 files, ~200 lines total:
- `index.ts`: CastingEngine to cast 2 agents, StreamingPipeline for token-by-token output, 12 hardcoded jokes, infinite loop
- `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`: Minimal Node/TS config matching other samples
- `Dockerfile`: Multi-stage build, copies monorepo context for local SDK dependency resolution
- `docker-compose.yml`: Single service, runs the sample
- `README.md`: Quick start guide

**Key SDK patterns demonstrated:**
1. **CastingEngine.castTeam()** — Cast from "usual-suspects" universe with required roles
2. **StreamingPipeline** — Simulated token-by-token streaming via `onDelta()` callback
3. **Demo mode** — Hardcoded responses (no live Copilot connection) for Docker-friendly demos
4. **Session attachment** — `pipeline.attachToSession()` for each agent

**Design constraint: SIMPLEST POSSIBLE.** No EventBus complexity, no SquadClientWithPool, no real Copilot auth. Just casting + streaming + simulated jokes. Perfect for first-time users.

**Verification:** TypeScript compiles clean, sample runs locally, outputs joke exchange with emoji and streaming delays.

## Learnings

- StreamingPipeline's `onDelta()` is the core pattern for rendering agent output — accumulate or stream directly to stdout
- Simulated streaming (demo mode) is essential for Docker samples where GitHub auth isn't available
- The `file:../../packages/squad-sdk` dependency pattern in samples allows testing SDK changes without publishing
- Multi-stage Dockerfile needed: builder stage copies monorepo workspace structure to resolve local dependencies, production stage copies built artifacts

## 2025-07: Fix semver prerelease format in bump-build (#692)

**Task:** `scripts/bump-build.mjs` produced invalid semver like `0.8.16.1-preview` (build number before prerelease tag). Fixed to produce `0.8.16-preview.1` (build as dot-separated prerelease identifier, per semver spec).

**What changed:**
- `parseVersion` split into two regex paths: prerelease-first (`1.2.3-tag.N`) and non-prerelease (`1.2.3.N`)
- `formatVersion` places build number after the prerelease tag when one exists
- All 5 tests updated to use new format, all passing

## Learnings

- Semver prerelease identifiers are dot-separated after the hyphen: `1.2.3-preview.1` is valid, `1.2.3.1-preview` is not
- The bump-build test suite copies the real script to a temp dir and patches `__dirname` — any regex changes must not break the patching mechanism

---

## 2025-07: Knock-Knock Sample Rewrite — Real LLM Integration

**Requested by:** Brady. Rewrite `samples/knock-knock/index.ts` to use REAL Copilot sessions instead of hardcoded jokes. Original version rejected because "it doesn't look like it's using any type of LLM or copilot functionality."

**What changed:** `samples/knock-knock/` completely rewritten (~190 lines):
- **SquadClientWithPool integration**: Real GitHub Copilot connection with `GITHUB_TOKEN` auth
- **Live LLM sessions**: Two Copilot sessions with distinct system prompts (Teller generates jokes, Responder plays audience)
- **StreamingPipeline + message_delta**: Pattern from `streaming-chat` — register delta listener, feed to pipeline, capture full response
- **Graceful auth errors**: Clear error messages if `GITHUB_TOKEN` missing/invalid, no stack traces
- **Infinite joke loop**: Agents swap roles after each joke, LLM generates unique jokes every time
- **docker-compose.yml**: Added `GITHUB_TOKEN=${GITHUB_TOKEN}` environment variable
- **README.md**: Rewritten to document GITHUB_TOKEN requirement, setup instructions, Docker usage

**Key SDK patterns demonstrated:**
1. **SquadClientWithPool**: Connect with GitHub token, create/resume sessions
2. **CastingEngine**: Cast two agents (unchanged pattern)
3. **StreamingPipeline**: Token-by-token streaming from live LLM (not simulated)
4. **Session management**: Creating sessions with system prompts, resuming, registering delta handlers
5. **sendAndWait with fallback**: `session.sendAndWait()` with optional fallback to `sendMessage()`

**Architecture:**
- Two sessions created with different system prompts defining agent personas
- `sendAndCapture()` helper: registers delta handler, sends prompt, captures full response text
- Role swap: agents alternate between Teller and Responder after each joke
- Streaming output: delta events piped to StreamingPipeline → stdout

**Verification:** TypeScript compiles clean (`tsc --noEmit` passes).

## Learnings

- Real LLM integration pattern: SquadClientWithPool → createSession with systemPrompt → resumeSession → register message_delta handler → sendAndWait → capture response
- System prompts define agent personas — Teller generates jokes, Responder plays natural audience role
- `sendAndWait()` may be optional on session interface — use conditional check with fallback to `sendMessage()`
- Auth error UX: check `GITHUB_TOKEN` before connecting, provide actionable error with setup instructions
- Captured response text enables inter-agent conversation — Teller's joke becomes Responder's input
