# Project Context

- **Owner:** Brady
- **Project:** squad-sdk — the programmable multi-agent runtime for GitHub Copilot (v1 replatform)
- **Stack:** TypeScript (strict mode, ESM-only), Node.js ≥20, @github/copilot-sdk, Vitest, esbuild
- **Created:** 2026-02-21

## Core Context

**Created:** 2026-02-21  
**Role:** Core Developer — Runtime implementation, CLI structure, shell infrastructure  
**Key Decisions Owned:** Test import patterns (vitest via dist/), CRLF normalization at parser entry, shell module structure (readline→ink progression), spawn lifecycle, SessionRegistry design

**Phase 1-2 Complete (2026-02-21 → 2026-02-22T041800Z):**
- M3 Resolution (#210/#211): `resolveSquad()` + `resolveGlobalSquadPath()` in src/resolution.ts, standalone concerns (no auto-fallback)
- CLI: --global flag routing, `squad status` command composition, command rename finalized (triage, loop, hire)
- Shell foundation: readline-based CLI shell, SessionRegistry (Map-backed, no persistence), spawn infrastructure (loadAgentCharter, buildAgentPrompt, spawnAgent)
- CRLF hardening: normalize-eol.ts applied to 8 parsers, one-line guard at entry point
- SDK/CLI split executed: 15 dirs + 4 files migrated to packages/, exports map updated (7→18 subpaths SDK, 14 subpaths CLI), 6 config files fixed, versions aligned to 0.8.0
- Test import migration: 56 test files migrated from ../src/ to @bradygaster/squad-sdk/* and @bradygaster/squad-cli/*, 26 SDK + 16 CLI subpath exports, vitest resolves via dist/, all 1719+ tests passing

### 📌 Team update (2026-02-22T10:03Z): PR #300 architecture review completed — REQUEST CHANGES verdict with 4 blockers (proposal doc, type safety on castingPolicy, missing sanitization, ambiguous .ai-team/ fallback) — decided by Keaton
- Zero-dependency scaffolding preserved, strict mode enforced, build clean (tsc 0 errors)

**Phase 3 Blocking (2026-02-22 onwards):**
- Ralph start(): EventBus subscription + health checks (14 TODOs)
- Coordinator initialize()/route(): CopilotClient wiring + agent manager (13 TODOs)
- Agents spawn(): SDK session creation + history injection (14 TODOs)
- Shell UI: Ink components not yet wired (readline only), streaming responses, agent status display
- Casting: registry.json parsing stub (1 TODO)
- Triage/Loop/Hire: placeholder commands (low priority, defer)

## Learnings

### 📌 Core Context: SDK/CLI Migration & Test Import Foundation

**SDK/CLI File Migration (2026-02-21):**
Migrated 15 directories (adapter, agents, build, casting, client, config, coordinator, hooks, marketplace, ralph, runtime, sharing, skills, tools, utils) and 4 files (index.ts, resolution.ts, parsers.ts, types.ts) into packages/squad-sdk/src/ and packages/squad-cli/src/. Updated exports maps: 18 SDK subpaths, 14 CLI subpaths. Rewrote 4 cross-package imports. SDK barrel cleaned (no CLI re-exports). Root src/ preserved. Pattern: SDK subpath exports resolve to dist/{module}/index.js.

**Test Import Migration (2026-02-21→2026-02-22):**
Migrated 56 test files (173 imports) from ../src/ to @bradygaster/squad-sdk/* and @bradygaster/squad-cli/*. 26 SDK + 16 CLI subpath exports. Added 8 new deep SDK exports (adapter/errors, config/migrations, runtime/event-bus, etc.). Verified barrel re-exports for missing symbols. All 1727 tests passing. Pattern: vitest resolves through compiled dist/, so barrel changes require npm run build.

### 📌 Runtime Implementation Assessment (2026-02-22T22:00Z) — Fenster
**Status:** Phase 1-2 complete (SDK/CLI split, monorepo structure). Phase 3 (runtime integration) blocked.

**Implemented & Working:**
- ✅ **SDK/CLI split:** Both packages at 0.8.0 (SDK)/0.8.1 (CLI). Clean exports maps (18 subpaths SDK, 14 subpaths CLI).
- ✅ **Build pipeline:** tsc compiles both packages to dist/, all dependencies resolved (SDK→Copilot SDK, CLI→SDK+ink+react). Zero errors.
- ✅ **CLI structure:** Entry point (cli-entry.ts) routes 14 commands. Commands implemented: `help`, `version`, `status`, `init`, `upgrade`, `export`, `import`, `copilot`, `plugin`, `scrub-emails`. Commands stubbed: `triage` (watch alias), `loop`, `hire`.
- ✅ **Shell foundation:** readline-based CLI shell with header chrome, session registry, spawn infrastructure. Agent discovery, charter loading, and spawn lifecycle foundation. Type-safe completion.
- ✅ **Core modules:** resolution.ts, config/, build/, skills/, hooks/, tools/, client/ (EventBus structure), marketplace/, adapter/ all present.
- ✅ **Monorepo:** npm workspaces, changesets configured, independent versioning (SDK/CLI can release separately).
### 📌 Team update (2026-02-22T041800Z): SDK/CLI split executed, versions aligned to 0.8.0, 1719 tests passing — decided by Keaton, Fenster, Edie, Kobayashi, Hockney, Rabin, Coordinator
- **Phase 1 (SDK):** Migrated 15 directories + 4 standalone files from root `src/` into `packages/squad-sdk/src/`. Cleaned SDK barrel (removed CLI re-exports block). Updated exports map from 7 to 18 subpath entries.
- **Phase 2 (CLI):** Migrated `src/cli/` + `src/cli-entry.ts` to `packages/squad-cli/src/`. Copied `templates/` into CLI package. Rewrote 6 cross-package imports to use `@bradygaster/squad-sdk/*` package names.
- **Configuration:** All 6 config files fixed (root tsconfig with project refs, SDK/CLI tconfigs with composite builds, package.json exports maps). Root marked private (prevents accidental npm publish).
- **Versions:** All strings aligned to 0.8.0 — clear break from 0.7.0 stubs. CLI dependency on SDK pinned to `0.8.0`.
- **Testing:** Build clean (0 errors), all 1719 tests passing. Test import migration deferred until root `src/` deletion (lazy migration reduces risk).
- **Distribution:** Both packages published to npm (@bradygaster/squad-sdk@0.8.0, @bradygaster/squad-cli@0.8.0). Publish workflows verified ready.
- **Dependency graph verified:** Clean DAG (CLI → SDK → @github/copilot-sdk, no cycles). SDK pure library (zero UI deps). CLI thin consumer (owns ink, react).
- **Next phase:** Phase 3 (root cleanup) — delete root src/, update test imports when blocking.


**Incomplete/Stubs (Phase 3 blockers):**
- ⏳ **Ralph monitor** (src/ralph/index.ts): Class structure present. 14 TODO comments (PRD 8). Methods stubbed: start(), handleEvent(), healthCheck(), stop(). EventBus subscription logic not wired.
- ⏳ **Coordinator** (src/coordinator/index.ts): Class structure present. 13 TODO comments (PRD 5). Methods stubbed: initialize(), route(), spawn(), monitor(), destroy(). No SquadClient wiring, no agent manager hookup.
- ⏳ **Agents module** (src/agents/index.ts): Charter compilation imported from separate file (working). SessionManager class present but 14 TODO comments (PRD 4). Methods stubbed: spawn(), resume(), terminate(). No SDK session creation wired.
- ⏳ **Casting system** (src/casting/index.ts): v1 CastingEngine imported (working). Legacy CastingRegistry stubbed — 1 TODO (PRD 11) for registry.json parsing. Cast/recast methods throw "Not implemented".
- ⏳ **Shell UI:** No ink-based components wired. readline loop exists but command handling is echo-only (line 78 in shell/index.ts). No agent discovery integration, no streaming response display, no real coordinator handoff.
- ⏳ **Triage/Loop/Hire commands:** Placeholder messages in cli-entry.ts lines 115-148. No implementation.

**Important TODOs in Code:**
- **Ralph (8):** start() needs EventBus subscription, health checks, persistent state loading/saving (8 items).
- **Coordinator (13):** initialize() needs client connection, charter loading, hook setup, EventBus wiring (13 items).
- **Agents (14):** spawn() needs charter reading, YAML parsing, SDK session creation with history injection (14 items).
- **Shell spawn.ts (1):** "Wire to CopilotClient session API" — CopilotClient session creation stubbed with TODO (line ~78 in spawn.ts).
- **Casting (1):** registry.json parsing stub.

**CLI Commands Status:**
- **Fully working (7):** help, version, status, init, upgrade, export, import, copilot, plugin, scrub-emails
- **Stubbed (3):** triage (watch alias), loop, hire — all print placeholder messages
- **Design note:** Commands are correct per Brady's directives (squad loop, squad triage, squad hire). Command routing works; implementations pending.

**Technical Debt:**
- **Phase 3 cleanup pending:** root `src/` directory still exists (backward compat). Will be deleted after monorepo migration complete per history.
- **Ink components:** No UI components wired yet. Shell uses readline only. Ink dependency is in CLI package.json but not used.
- **Event-driven flow:** EventBus is defined (event-bus.ts) but no actual event emission wired. Handler error isolation TODO (PRD 1).

**CLI Entry Point Wiring:**
- `main()` parses command and routes to implementations (all sync/await patterns clean).
- No external commands spawned yet (e.g., `gh api`, file system watch).
- `--global` flag works (resolveGlobalSquadPath routing correct).

**Build/Test/Lint Status:**
- ✅ **Build:** 0 errors (tsc clean).
- ✅ **Tests:** 1700+ passing (exact count varies by run, all passing).
- ✅ **Lint:** tsc --noEmit clean (strict mode enforced).

**Next Phase Blocking Items:**
1. Wire EventBus: Actual event emission from sessions + handler execution in coordinator/ralph.
2. CopilotClient session integration: Ralph.start() and spawnAgent() need live session creation/resumption.
3. Coordinator.initialize() and route(): Accept user message, load charters, route to agents.
4. Shell UI: Wire ink components for agent display, streaming responses, session status.

### 📌 Team update (2026-02-22T08:50:00Z): Ink Shell Wiring — ShellApi callback pattern — decided by Fenster
App component accepts `onReady` prop that fires on mount, delivering ShellApi object with `addMessage`, `setStreamingContent`, `refreshAgents` methods. Host captures API and wires to StreamBridge callbacks. Keeps Ink component decoupled from bridge internals. Streaming content accumulation uses per-agent buffers. Ready for coordinator integration (Phase 3).
5. Triage/Loop/Hire: Implement placeholder commands (low priority, can defer).

**Assessment for Brady:** Core runtime foundation is solid — SDK/CLI split is complete, command routing works, type safety is enforced. Phase 3 (integrating with CopilotClient, EventBus event emission, Coordinator logic) is the next lift. Ralph and Coordinator are well-structured but need internal wiring. No broken code — just incomplete TODOs. Estimate 2-3 weeks to wire Phase 3 fully.

### 📌 Team update (2026-02-22T070156Z): Test import migration merged to decisions, CLI functions correctly exported from CLI package — decided by Fenster, Edie, Hockney
- **Test import migration decision:** 56 test files migrated from `../src/` to `@bradygaster/squad-sdk` / `@bradygaster/squad-cli`. 26 SDK subpath exports, 16 CLI subpath exports. Barrel re-exports verified for missing symbols. All 1727 tests passing.
- **CLI function placement clarified:** runInit, runExport, runImport, scrubEmails correctly exported from `@bradygaster/squad-cli` (not SDK), reflecting intentional architecture separation.
- **Pattern established:** Vitest resolves through compiled `dist/`, so barrel changes require `npm run build` in the package before tests see them.
- **Decision merged to decisions.md.** Status: Test infrastructure aligned with workspace split, ready for Phase 3 runtime integration.

### 📌 Ink shell wiring (2026-02-22) — Fenster
- **Replaced readline loop with Ink render** in `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/shell/index.ts`. The `runShell()` function now uses `ink.render()` + `waitUntilExit()` instead of `readline.createInterface`.
- **Created `App.tsx`** (`packages/squad-cli/src/cli/shell/components/App.tsx`) — main Ink component composing AgentPanel, MessageStream, InputPrompt. Manages messages, agents, streaming state via React hooks.
- **ShellApi pattern:** App exposes an `onReady` callback prop that delivers a `ShellApi` object (`addMessage`, `setStreamingContent`, `refreshAgents`). This lets the host wire StreamBridge callbacks into React state without coupling the component to the bridge directly.
- **StreamBridge wiring:** `runShell()` creates a StreamBridge with callbacks that accumulate content deltas in a local `streamBuffers` Map, then push accumulated content into the Ink component via ShellApi. The bridge is ready for coordinator integration — just call `_bridge.handleEvent(event)`.
- **Router + command handler integration:** App's `handleSubmit` calls `parseInput()` for input classification and `executeCommand()` for slash commands. Direct agent and coordinator messages produce system placeholders until coordinator is wired.
- **Exit handling:** `/quit`, `/exit` (via executeCommand), bare `exit` (via EXIT_WORDS set), and Ctrl+C (via `useInput` + `useApp().exit()` with `exitOnCtrlC: false`). Farewell message "👋 Squad out." printed after `waitUntilExit()`.
- **index.ts uses `React.createElement`** instead of JSX to avoid renaming the file to .tsx. All existing exports preserved. New exports: `App`, `ShellApi`, `AppProps`.
- **No test breakage:** All 60 previously-passing test files still pass (1813 tests). 5 pre-existing failures in agent-session-manager.test.ts are unrelated.
- **Key file paths:** `components/App.tsx`, `components/index.ts`, `shell/index.ts`.

### 📌 OpenTelemetry tracing instrumentation (2026-02-22) — Fenster (Issues #257, #258)
- **Added `@opentelemetry/api`** as a dependency in `packages/squad-sdk`. Imported `trace` and `SpanStatusCode` only — no SDK packages.
- **Instrumented 4 files:** `agents/index.ts` (AgentSessionManager: spawn/resume/destroy), `agents/lifecycle.ts` (AgentLifecycleManager: spawnAgent/destroyAgent), `coordinator/index.ts` (Coordinator: initialize/route/execute/shutdown), `coordinator/coordinator.ts` (SquadCoordinator: handleMessage).
- **Span naming convention:** `squad.{module}.{method}` — e.g. `squad.agent.spawn`, `squad.coordinator.route`.
- **Error pattern:** catch block sets `SpanStatusCode.ERROR` + `recordException()`, then re-throws. `span.end()` always in `finally`.
- **No-op by default:** Without a registered TracerProvider, all spans are no-ops. Zero overhead unless OTel is configured.
- **Build:** 0 errors in instrumented files (2 pre-existing errors in Fortier's `otel.ts` — unrelated SDK type mismatch).
- **Tests:** All 1828 passing tests unaffected. 23 pre-existing failures in `otel-provider.test.ts` are Fortier's parallel work.

### 📌 Tool trace enhancements + agent metric wiring (2026-02-22) — Fenster (Issues #260, #262)
- **Issue #260 — Tool traces enhanced** in `tools/index.ts`:
  - Added `sanitizeArgs()` — strips fields matching `/token|secret|password|key|auth/i`, truncates to 1024 chars. Exported for reuse.
  - `defineTool` now accepts optional `agentName` in config → recorded as `agent.name` span attribute.
  - `squad.tool.result` event now includes `result.length` (textResultForLlm length).
  - `duration_ms` verified present on both result and error events (was already there, confirmed consistent).
  - TODO comment added re: parent span context propagation (deferred until agent.work span lifecycle is complete).
- **Issue #262 — Agent metrics wired** into lifecycle code:
  - `AgentSessionManager` (agents/index.ts): `recordAgentSpawn` in spawn(), `recordAgentDuration`+`recordAgentDestroy` in destroy(), `recordAgentError` in catch blocks.
  - `AgentLifecycleManager` (agents/lifecycle.ts): `recordAgentSpawn` in spawnAgent(), `recordAgentDestroy` in destroyAgent(), `recordAgentError` in catch.
  - Duration computed from `createdAt` timestamp in destroy path.
- **Build:** tsc clean (0 errors). **Tests:** All 1886 tests passing (65 files).

### 📌 Team update (2026-02-22T093300Z): OTel Phase 2 complete — session traces, latency metrics, tool enhancements, agent metrics, token usage wiring, metrics tests — decided by Fortier, Fenster, Edie, Hockney
All four agents shipped Phase 2 in parallel: Fortier wired TTFT/duration/throughput metrics. Fenster established tool trace patterns and agent metric wiring conventions. Edie wired token usage and session pool metrics. Hockney created spy-meter test pattern (39 new tests). Total: 1940 tests passing, metrics ready for production telemetry.
### 📌 Team update (2026-02-22T020714Z): CRLF normalization complete and merged
Fenster's src/utils/normalize-eol.ts utility is now applied to 8 parser entry points across 6 files. Pattern established: normalize at parser entry, not at file-read callsite. This ensures cross-platform line ending safety for all parsers (Windows CRLF, Unix LF, old Mac CR). Decision merged to decisions.md. Issue #220, #221 closed. All 1683 tests passing.

### 📌 SDK/CLI File Migration — Keaton's split plan executed
- **Phase 1 (SDK):** Copied all 15 directories (adapter, agents, build, casting, client, config, coordinator, hooks, marketplace, ralph, runtime, sharing, skills, tools, utils) and 4 standalone files (index.ts, resolution.ts, parsers.ts, types.ts) from root `src/` into `packages/squad-sdk/src/`. Cleaned the SDK barrel (`packages/squad-sdk/src/index.ts`) — removed the CLI re-exports block (lines 25-52 of the original, exporting success/error/warn/fatal/SquadError/detectSquadDir/runWatch/runInit/runExport/runImport/runCopilot etc. from `./cli/index.js`). Updated SDK `package.json` exports map: removed `./cli`, added all subpath exports from Keaton's plan (resolution, runtime/streaming, coordinator, hooks, tools, adapter, client, marketplace, build, sharing, ralph, casting).
- **Phase 2 (CLI):** Copied `src/cli/` directory and `src/cli-entry.ts` into `packages/squad-cli/src/`. Copied `templates/` into `packages/squad-cli/templates/`. Rewrote 4 cross-package imports in CLI source:
  - `cli/upgrade.ts`: `../config/migration.js` → `@bradygaster/squad-sdk/config`
  - `cli/copilot-install.ts`: `../config/init.js` → `@bradygaster/squad-sdk/config`
  - `cli/shell/spawn.ts`: `../../resolution.js` → `@bradygaster/squad-sdk/resolution`
  - `cli/shell/stream-bridge.ts`: `../../runtime/streaming.js` → `@bradygaster/squad-sdk/runtime/streaming`
  - `cli-entry.ts`: `./resolution.js` and `./index.js` → `@bradygaster/squad-sdk`
- **Intra-CLI imports** (within `cli/` directory) left untouched — all relative.
- **Root `src/` preserved** — not deleted, per plan (cleanup after tests pass).
- Pattern: SDK subpath exports match the directory barrel structure — `@bradygaster/squad-sdk/{module}` resolves to `dist/{module}/index.js`. Special cases: `./resolution` → `dist/resolution.js`, `./runtime/streaming` → `dist/runtime/streaming.js`.

### 📌 Test import migration to workspace packages — completed
- Migrated all 56 test files (173 import replacements) from relative `../src/` paths to workspace package imports.
- SDK imports use 26 subpath exports (18 existing + 8 new): `@bradygaster/squad-sdk/config`, `@bradygaster/squad-sdk/agents`, etc.
- CLI imports use 16 new subpath exports: `@bradygaster/squad-cli/shell/sessions`, `@bradygaster/squad-cli/core/init`, etc.
- Added 8 new SDK subpath exports for deep modules not covered by barrels: `adapter/errors`, `config/migrations`, `runtime/event-bus`, `runtime/benchmarks`, `runtime/i18n`, `runtime/telemetry`, `runtime/offline`, `runtime/cost-tracker`.
- Added missing barrel re-exports: `selectResponseTier`/`getTier` in coordinator/index.ts, `onboardAgent`/`addAgentToConfig` in agents/index.ts.
- Updated consumer-imports test: CLI functions (`runInit`, `runExport`, `runImport`, `scrubEmails`) now imported from `@bradygaster/squad-cli` instead of SDK barrel.
- Rebuilt SDK and CLI packages to update dist. All 1727 tests pass across 57 files.
- Pattern: vitest resolves through compiled `dist/` files, not TypeScript source — barrel changes require a package rebuild to take effect.
- Pattern: when consolidating deep imports to barrel paths, verify the barrel actually re-exports the needed symbols before assuming availability.

### 📌 PR #300 Code Quality Review — Upstream Inheritance (2026-02-22) — Fenster
- **Reviewed:** resolver.ts (236 lines), upstream.ts CLI (228 lines), types.ts (56 lines), upstream/index.ts barrel, SDK barrel+exports, 2 test files (509 lines total), package-lock.json
- **Verdict:** Approve with required fixes (5 items). Architecture is sound — types in SDK, CLI command in CLI package, barrel exports correct.
- **Critical finding (from Baer, confirmed):** `execSync` string interpolation in upstream.ts is CWE-78 command injection. Must switch to `execFileSync` with array args.
- **Bug found:** upstream.ts imports `error as fatal` from `output.ts` (which just prints and returns void). Existing pattern uses `fatal()` from `errors.ts` (which throws SquadError, return type `never`). This means after "fatal" error messages, execution continues to the next `if (action === ...)` block. The explicit `return` statements mask this but the pattern is wrong and fragile.
- **Missing integration:** `upstream` command is not registered in `cli-entry.ts` command router. Users can't actually invoke it.
- **Test import pattern violated:** Tests import from `../packages/squad-sdk/src/upstream/resolver.js` (relative source paths) instead of `@bradygaster/squad-sdk/upstream` (package imports). Violates the test import migration decision.
- **Minor:** Test uses `(org.castingPolicy as any)` — should use typed cast `as Record<string, unknown>` per strict-mode decision.
### 📌 OTel Phase 4: Aspire command + Squad Observer file watcher (2026-02-22) — Fenster (Issues #265, #268)
- **Issue #265 — `squad aspire` command** added at `packages/squad-cli/src/cli/commands/aspire.ts`:
  - Launches the .NET Aspire dashboard for viewing Squad OTel telemetry.
  - Auto-detects Docker vs dotnet Aspire workload; falls back to Docker.
  - Sets `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` env var so OTel providers auto-export.
  - Flags: `--docker` (force Docker), `--port <number>` (custom OTLP port, default 18888).
  - Wired into CLI entry point (`cli-entry.ts`) with help text.
  - Subpath export: `@bradygaster/squad-cli/commands/aspire`.
- **Issue #268 — SquadObserver file watcher** added at `packages/squad-sdk/src/runtime/squad-observer.ts`:
  - Watches `.squad/` directory recursively via `fs.watch()` with debounce (200ms default).
  - Classifies files into categories: agent, casting, config, decision, skill, unknown.
  - Emits OTel spans (`squad.observer.start`, `squad.observer.stop`, `squad.observer.file_change`) with file.path, file.category, change.type attributes.
  - Emits EventBus events (`agent:milestone` type) when an EventBus is provided.
  - Full start/stop lifecycle with error handling and OTel error spans.
  - Subpath export: `@bradygaster/squad-sdk/runtime/squad-observer`.
  - Barrel export in SDK index.ts: `SquadObserver`, `classifyFile`, types.
- **Tests:** 16 new tests (14 observer: classifyFile categories, start/stop, OTel spans, EventBus events, idempotency; 2 aspire: module exports). All 2024 tests passing.
- **Pattern:** `classifyFile()` normalizes Windows backslashes before classification — cross-platform safe.
- **Pattern:** Observer uses `fs.watch` with `{ recursive: true }` — works on Windows/macOS, may need inotify tuning on Linux.

### 📌 Spawn wiring + error handling cleanup (2026-02-22) — Fenster
- **spawn.ts wired to SquadClient:** `spawnAgent()` now accepts `client: SquadClient` via `SpawnOptions`. When provided, creates a real SDK session with the agent's charter as system prompt, sends the task, streams `message_delta` events, accumulates the response, closes the session, and returns the result in `SpawnResult`. Without a client, returns a backward-compatible stub.
- **Pattern mirrors shell/index.ts `dispatchToAgent()`** but is self-contained — no dependency on Ink components, ShellApi, or StreamBridge. Can be used outside the shell (e.g., from coordinator, CLI commands, or programmatic API).
- **Error handling audit:** Removed unused `error` import from `plugin.ts` (already correctly uses `fatal()` from `errors.ts`). Removed unused `error as errorMsg` import from `upgrade.ts` (same — already uses `fatal()`). `upstream.ts` has the `error as fatal` bug but is owned by Baer.
- **TODO removed:** "Wire to CopilotClient session API" in spawn.ts — resolved by this change.
- **TODO deferred:** "Parent span context propagation" in `tools/index.ts` — requires agent.work span lifecycle to be complete first. Left in place.
- **Build:** tsc clean (0 errors). **Tests:** 47 shell tests passing.
