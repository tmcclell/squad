# Breedan — History

## Project Context
- **Project:** Squad — programmable multi-agent runtime for GitHub Copilot
- **Owner:** Brady
- **Stack:** TypeScript (strict, ESM), Node.js ≥20, Ink 6 (React for CLI), Vitest
- **Existing tests:** test/*.test.ts using Vitest, ink-testing-library for component tests
- **Key files:** vitest.config.ts, test/repl-ux.test.ts (existing ink component tests)

## Learnings

### E2E Terminal Harness Design (2026-02-23)

**Architecture Decision:** Built terminal harness using `child_process.spawn` with pipes instead of node-pty. This pragmatic approach avoids native compilation issues on Windows and provides cross-platform compatibility. The harness API is designed to be compatible with node-pty, so we can upgrade later when CI has build tools without breaking tests.

**Key Components:**
- `test/acceptance/harness.ts` — TerminalHarness class for spawning CLI and capturing output
- `test/acceptance/support/gherkin.ts` — Minimal Gherkin parser (no external deps)
- `test/acceptance/support/runner.ts` — Test runner that maps Gherkin steps to vitest
- `test/acceptance/steps/cli-steps.ts` — Given/When/Then step definitions
- `test/acceptance/features/*.feature` — 5 Gherkin feature files (version, help, status, error-handling, doctor)
- `test/ux-gates.test.ts` — UX quality gates (overflow, error remediation, clean output)

**Patterns:**
- CLI spawned with `node packages/squad-cli/dist/cli-entry.js [args]`
- Environment variables used to control terminal size (COLUMNS, LINES) and disable interactivity (TERM=dumb, NO_COLOR=1)
- Output accumulated in append-only buffer for waitForText assertions
- ANSI codes stripped using simple regex (no extra dependencies)
- Tests focus on non-interactive commands (--version, --help, status, doctor) since interactive shell requires Copilot SDK unavailable in test environment

**UX Gates Philosophy:**
- Quality gates document existing behavior and catch regressions
- Pragmatic thresholds (120 char max, not 80) balance ideals with reality
- Informational logging for soft constraints (lines exceeding 80 chars)
- Hard assertions for critical issues (error messages include remediation)

**Test Results:** All 13 tests passing (7 acceptance scenarios + 6 UX gates)
