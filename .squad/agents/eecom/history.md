### Privacy scrub messaging + EPERM + gitignore parent coverage (#549) (2026-07-14)

**Context:** Upgrade footer message always said "Preserves user state" even when the email privacy scrub had run — a direct contradiction of what just happened. Two related issues in the same function: EPERM on read-only `.gitattributes` would crash the upgrade, and `.gitignore` would add redundant entries already covered by parent paths (e.g. `.squad/log/` when `.squad/` was already present).

**Fix:**
1. `upgrade.ts` — `ensureGitattributes` catches EPERM/EACCES and returns `[]` with a console.warn, graceful degradation.
2. `upgrade.ts` — `ensureGitignore` skips an entry when any existing line is a parent prefix of it.
3. `upgrade.ts` — Footer logic checks whether the email scrub actually ran; shows "Privacy scrub applied" or "Preserves user state" accordingly.
4. `test/cli/upgrade.test.ts` — Added EPERM test using `chmodSync` (fix: `chmodSync` was missing from the `fs` import — added it).

**Pattern:** When adding a new fs function to a test, always verify the named import list at the top of the test file. Missing named imports from `'fs'` produce `ReferenceError` at runtime, not at type-check time (if the test file isn't part of the main tsconfig).

📌 **Team update (2026-03-22T09-35Z — Wave 1):** Economy mode fully implemented: ECONOMY_MODEL_MAP + resolveModel() integration in SDK, `squad economy on|off` CLI command, `--economy` flag, 34 tests passing. PR #504 open for review. Soft dependency: #464 rate limit UX should offer economy mode as recovery. Next: Phase 1 of ambient personal squad (T1–T5, T19) — ready to start immediately after merging current work. Procedures wrote governance proposals for squad.agent.md — awaiting Flight review.
### Rate Limit UX (#464) (2026-03-20)

**Context:** Users hitting Copilot rate limits saw generic "Something went wrong processing your message." Squad hid the actual error. `squad doctor` reported nothing — useless to diagnose.

**Root cause:** The catch block in `shell/index.ts` line ~1119 always emitted `genericGuidance()` unless `SQUAD_DEBUG=1`. Rate limit errors never got special treatment despite `RateLimitError` existing in `adapter/errors.ts`.

**Fix:**
1. `error-messages.ts` — Added `rateLimitGuidance({ retryAfter?, model? })` and `extractRetryAfter(message)` utilities. Rate limit guidance shows clear message + recovery options (retry time, `squad economy on`, config.json model override).
2. `shell/index.ts` — Catch block now detects rate limits via `instanceof RateLimitError` OR regex on the raw message. Writes `.squad/rate-limit-status.json` on detection.
3. `doctor.ts` — Added `checkRateLimitStatus()` check. Reads status file and warns if rate limit was recent.
4. `test/error-messages.test.ts` — Added 11 new tests covering `rateLimitGuidance` and `extractRetryAfter`.

**Pattern:** Rate limit status written to `.squad/rate-limit-status.json` as `{ timestamp, retryAfter, model, message }`. Doctor reads it on next run. File is never deleted automatically — doctor marks it `pass` when > 4h stale.

**Import path for `RateLimitError`:** `@bradygaster/squad-sdk/adapter/errors` (subpath export, not in main barrel).

**PR:** #464 fix — squad/464-rate-limit-ux

### CLI Entry Point Architecture
cli-entry.ts is the central router for ~30+ CLI commands using dynamic imports (lazy-loading). Commands are routed via if-else blocks. Has a recurring "unwired command" bug class — implementations exist in cli/commands/ but aren't routed in cli-entry.ts. The cli-command-wiring.test.ts regression test catches this by verifying every .ts file in cli/commands/ is imported.

### ESM Runtime Patch
Module._resolveFilename interceptor in cli-entry.ts (lines 47-54) patches broken ESM import in @github/copilot-sdk@0.1.32 (vscode-jsonrpc/node missing .js extension). Required for Node 24+ strict ESM enforcement. Works on npx cache hits where postinstall scripts don't run.

### Lazy Import Pattern
All command imports use `await import('./cli/commands/xxx.js')` to minimize startup time. Copilot SDK is lazily loaded only when shell is invoked. All .js extensions required for Node 24+ strict ESM.

### CLI Packaging & Distribution
`npm pack` produces a complete, installable tarball (~275KB packed, 1.2MB unpacked). Package includes dist/, templates/, scripts/, README.md per package.json "files" field. Postinstall script (patch-esm-imports.mjs) patches @github/copilot-sdk for Node 24+ compatibility. Tarball can be installed locally (`npm install ./tarball.tgz`) and commands execute via `node node_modules/@bradygaster/squad-cli/dist/cli-entry.js`. Both squad-cli and squad-sdk must be installed together — cli depends on sdk with "*" version specifier. All 27+ CLI commands are lazy-loaded at runtime; `--help` validates command routing without executing full logic.

### Packaging Smoke Test Strategy
test/cli-packaging-smoke.test.ts validates the packaged artifact (not source). Uses npm pack + install in temp dir + command routing verification. Commands are expected to fail (no .squad/ dir) — test verifies routing only (no "Unknown command", no MODULE_NOT_FOUND for the command itself). Exception: node-pty is an optional dependency for the `start` command and MODULE_NOT_FOUND for node-pty is allowed. Windows cleanup requires retry logic due to EBUSY errors — use rmSync with maxRetries + retryDelay options, wrap in try/catch to fail silently since tests have passed.

### v0.8.24 Release Readiness Audit
CLI completeness audit (2026-03-08) confirmed: 26 primary commands routed in cli-entry.ts, all present in smoke test. 4 aliases (watch→triage, workstreams→subsquads, remote-control→rc, streams→subsquads). 3 aliases tested, 1 untested ("streams"). Packaging verified: dist/, templates/, scripts/, README.md in tarball; bin entry points to dist/cli-entry.js; postinstall script included and working. All 32 smoke tests pass. Package.json files array correct. npm pack output shows 318 files, 275KB packed. No missing command implementations. Optional dep (node-pty) handled correctly. Only gap: "streams" alias not in smoke test (routed correctly but test coverage incomplete). Confidence: 95% — all critical paths covered, minor alias test gap non-blocking.

📌 **Team update (2026-03-08T21:18:00Z):** FIDO + EECOM released unanimous GO verdict for v0.8.24. Smoke test approved as release gate. FIDO confirmed 32/32 pass + publish.yml wired correctly. EECOM confirmed 26/26 commands + packaging complete (minor gap: "streams" alias untested, non-blocking).

### Cross-Platform Filename and Config Fixes (#348, #356) (2026-03-15T05:30:00Z)

**Context:** Two cross-platform bugs broke Squad on Windows: (1) log filenames contained colons in ISO 8601 timestamps (illegal on Windows), (2) `.squad/config.json` contained absolute machine-specific `teamRoot` path.

**Investigation:**
- Searched SDK for all timestamp usage in filenames — found `safeTimestamp()` utility already existed but wasn't consistently used
- `comms-file-log.ts` (line 32) used inline `toISOString().replace(/:/g, '-')` instead of utility
- `init.ts` (line 612) wrote absolute `teamRoot` to config.json on every init
- Session-store already used `safeTimestamp()` correctly (line 71)

**Fixes:**
1. **Bug #348:** Updated `comms-file-log.ts` to import and use `safeTimestamp()` utility instead of inline timestamp formatting
2. **Bug #356:** Removed `teamRoot` field from config.json (can be computed at runtime via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`)
3. Updated live `.squad/config.json` in repo to remove machine-specific path

**Pattern:** Centralized timestamp formatting in `safeTimestamp()` utility (replaces colons + truncates milliseconds). Windows-safe format: `2026-03-15T05-30-00Z` instead of `2026-03-15T05:30:00.123Z`.

**Test Impact:** All 150 tests pass. Communication adapter test doesn't validate specific filename format (structural test, not behavioral).

**PR:** #404 opened targeting dev.

### CastingEngine CLI Integration (#342) (2026-03-15T11:20:00Z)

**Context:** CastingEngine class (Issue #138, M3-2) existed in SDK with curated universe templates (The Usual Suspects, Ocean's Eleven) but was completely bypassed during `squad init`. LLM picked arbitrary names, and charter generation used regex-based `personalityForRole()` instead of template backstories.

**Investigation:**
- CastingEngine.castTeam() was never called in CLI flow
- coordinator.ts buildInitModePrompt() let LLM pick any universe without guidance
- cast.ts generateCharter() used fallback personality logic instead of engine data
- SDK exports two AgentRole types: broad one in casting-engine.ts, restrictive one in runtime/constants.ts

**Integration Strategy (Augment, Not Replace):**
- LLM still proposes roles and team composition (the beloved casting experience)
- CastingEngine augments with curated names when universe is recognized
- Mapping: "The Usual Suspects" → 'usual-suspects', "Ocean's Eleven" → 'oceans-eleven'
- Unrecognized universes (Matrix, Alien, etc.) preserve LLM's arbitrary names

**Implementation:**
1. Added `augmentWithCastingEngine()` in cast.ts to replace LLM names with engine characters
2. Updated coordinator prompt to suggest preferred universes (Usual Suspects, Ocean's Eleven)
3. Extended `generateCharter()` to use engine personalities/backstories when available
4. Attached `_personality` and `_backstory` to CastMember objects for charter generation
5. Role mapping: CLI role strings → engine AgentRole enum (lead, developer, tester, etc.)

**Type Import Pattern:**
- Import CastingEngine from `@bradygaster/squad-sdk/casting` (not main barrel export)
- Use casting-engine.ts AgentRole type (9 roles) not runtime/constants.ts (6 roles)
- Partial mapping: unmapped roles log warning and skip engine casting

**Tests:**
- Created test/casting-engine-integration.test.ts (5 tests, all pass)
- Validates augmentation for both universes, case-insensitive matching, fallback behavior
- All 45 existing cast-parser/casting tests still pass

**PR:** #417 opened targeting dev.


### PR #427 Cross-Fork Rebase (2026-03-15T21:00:00Z)

**Context:** PR #427 (PAO external communications Phase 1) conflicted with upstream/dev after team recast (#423 Usual Suspects → Apollo 13) and model updates. Cross-repo PR (diberry/squad → bradygaster/squad). Initial rebase attempts failed due to git worktree confusion — main worktree was checked out to a different branch, causing git checkout commands to silently switch to wrong branches.

**Problem:** Git commands (checkout, rebase) kept switching to unrelated branches (squad/agent-on-disk-concept, squad/320-fix-migration-guide-version-local) mid-rebase. Root cause: main worktree at C:\Users\diberry\repos\project-squad\squad was checked out to squad/agent-on-disk-concept. Git was treating checkout commands as worktree operations and switching the main worktree's HEAD, aborting the rebase.

**Solution:** Created dedicated worktree (.worktrees/pao-rebase) for the rebase operation. This isolated the rebase from main worktree state and prevented branch switching.

**Conflict Resolution (3 files, 7 commits rebased):**
1. **.squad/agents/_alumni/mcmanus/charter.md** - Merged both rule sets: DOCS-TEST SYNC (from upstream reskill) and EXTERNAL COMMS, HUMANIZER, AUDIT TRAIL (from PR #427). Used PowerShell regex to extract and combine both sides.
2. **.squad/routing.md** - Accepted Apollo 13 team names (EECOM, PAO, FIDO) from upstream via `git checkout --ours` (in rebase context, "ours" = upstream, "theirs" = our branch). PAO external comms infrastructure is team-agnostic.
3. **.squad/agents/keaton/history.md** - Accepted deletion via `git rm` (file moved to _alumni in upstream recast).

**Rebase Commits:** 7 commits from squad/426-pao-external-comms rebased onto upstream/dev (f87a7a5), covering #423 team reskill, #424 SDK switch, #425/#428 test parity, #429 model updates.

**Force Push:** `git push origin squad/426-pao-external-comms --force-with-lease` succeeded. PR #427 comment posted via gh CLI.

**Pattern:** When working with git worktrees, always create a dedicated worktree for complex operations (rebase, cherry-pick) to avoid main worktree state interference. Use `git worktree list` to diagnose unexpected branch switching.
### SDK Init Flow Deep Dive (2026-03-08)
Traced complete `squad init --sdk` flow end-to-end for unified PRD. Key findings: (1) Init flow has two phases: CLI init creates skeleton files, REPL auto-cast creates team members. (2) Critical gap: squad.config.ts is never updated after auto-cast — members exist in .squad/ but not in config. (3) Ralph is inconsistently created (auto-cast yes, CLI init no). (4) No commands exist for adding/removing members post-init. (5) CastingEngine class exists but is never called during init — LLM-based Init Mode prompt is used instead. Roadmap written to .squad/identity/sdk-init-implementation-roadmap.md with 7 fixes prioritized by dependency graph. Critical path: sync utility → Ralph fixes → CastingEngine integration → hire/remove commands. High-risk items: squad.config.ts AST parsing (considered regex alternative). Open questions: AST vs regex for config sync, CastingEngine augment vs replace LLM, Ralph always-on vs opt-in.

📌 **Team update (2026-03-11T01:25:00Z):** SDK Init decisions finalized: Phase-based quality improvement program, CastingEngine canonical casting, squad.config.ts as source of truth, Ralph always-included, implementation priority order (sync utility first, then Ralph fixes, then CastingEngine integration). All decisions merged to decisions.md. Ready to start Phase 1 implementation.

### Adoption Tracking Tier 1 Implementation (2026-03-10)
Implemented Flight's privacy-first adoption monitoring strategy on PR #326 branch. Moved `.squad/adoption/` → `.github/adoption/` for better GitHub integration. Stripped tracking.md to aggregate-only metrics (removed all individual repo names/URLs). Updated GitHub Action workflow (adoption-report.yml) and monitoring script (scripts/adoption-monitor.mjs) to write reports to `.github/adoption/reports/`. Removed "Built with Squad" showcase link from README.md (deferred to Tier 2 opt-in feature). This honors the principle: collect aggregate metrics via public APIs, but never publish individual repo lists without explicit consent. Test discipline: verified npm run build passes; docs-build.test.ts passed structure tests (Astro build failure unrelated to changes). Committed with clear message explaining privacy rationale.

📌 **Team update (2026-03-10T12-55-49Z):** Adoption tracking Tier 1 complete and merged to decisions.md. Privacy-first architecture confirmed: aggregate metrics only, opt-in for individual repos, public showcase only when 5+ projects opt in. Append-only file governance enforced (no deletions in history.md or decisions.md). Microsoft ampersand style guide adopted for documentation.

### Economy Mode Implementation (#500) (2026-03-20)

**Context:** Issue #500 requested economy mode — a session-level and persistent modifier that shifts model selection to cheaper alternatives.

**Architecture decision:** Economy mode is a Layer 3/4 modifier only. Layers 0–2 (explicit user preferences: config.json, session directive, charter) are never downgraded. This preserves user intent while enabling cost savings on auto-selected tasks.

**Implementation:**
1. `ECONOMY_MODEL_MAP` + `applyEconomyMode()` in `config/models.ts` — pure mapping function for premium→standard and standard→fast downgrades
2. `readEconomyMode()` + `writeEconomyMode()` — config.json read/write functions (same merge-without-clobber pattern as `writeModelPreference()`)
3. `resolveModel()` in `config/models.ts` updated with `economyMode?: boolean` option; falls back to reading from `squadDir` if not provided
4. `resolveModel()` in `agents/model-selector.ts` updated with `economyMode?: boolean` — both SDK resolvers are economy-aware
5. `squad economy [on|off]` command in CLI for persistent toggle
6. `--economy` global flag in `cli-entry.ts` sets `SQUAD_ECONOMY_MODE=1` env var for session scope
7. 34 new tests in `test/economy-mode.test.ts` — all pass

**Key pattern:** Both resolveModel implementations follow identical principle: explicit overrides (user choice) are sacred; economy only affects computed auto-selection.

**PR:** #500 branch `squad/500-economy-mode`

### node:sqlite Hard-Fail Fix (#502) (2026-03-21)

**Context:** Workshop participants (reported by Doron Ben Elazar) were blocked by `ERR_UNKNOWN_BUILTIN_MODULE` crashes. `node:sqlite` (used by Copilot SDK for session storage) requires Node 22.5.0+. The existing soft-warn-and-continue approach let users limp into a cryptic crash.

**Root cause:** `engines.node` said `>=20` but `node:sqlite` needs `>=22.5.0`. The pre-flight check warned but didn't exit, so users saw confusing failures deep in SDK code.

**Fix:**
1. **cli-entry.ts:** Replaced `try { await import('node:sqlite') } catch { warn }` with a synchronous version check that calls `process.exit(1)` immediately with a clear upgrade message. Removed the now-dead `checkNodeSqlite()` function and its call site.
2. **doctor.ts:** Added `checkNodeVersion()` to `squad doctor` — exported with optional version param for testability.
3. **package.json (×3):** Corrected `engines.node` to `>=22.5.0` so npm/npx warn at install time.
4. **Tests:** 5 new tests for `checkNodeVersion()` (Node 20.x fail, 22.4.x fail, 22.5.0 pass, 24.x pass, current env pass). Updated check-count assertion.

**Pattern:** git branch confusion — `git checkout -b` switches HEAD but edits to files on wrong branch are lost when switching. Always confirm `git branch` before making file edits. File edits don't follow you to a new branch if you forgot to switch first.

**PR:** #506 branch `squad/502-node-sqlite-dependency`

### Rate Limit Recovery UX (#464) (2026-03-22)

**Context:** Rate limit errors showed generic message with no actionable recovery. Brady directive: offer model switching + economy mode as recovery options.

**Implementation:**
1. `error-messages.ts` — `rateLimitGuidance()` shows actual reason + 3 recovery options (retry time, `squad economy on`, config.json model override)
2. `shell/index.ts` — Detects rate limits via `instanceof RateLimitError` or regex; writes `.squad/rate-limit-status.json`
3. `doctor.ts` — `checkRateLimitStatus()` reads status file and warns if recent
4. 36 new tests — all pass

**PR:** #505 `squad/464-rate-limit-ux` — merged (rebased after #504)

### Session 2 Summary (2026-03-22)

Executed 3 tasks across 2 waves: economy mode (#500, PR #504), node:sqlite fix (#502, PR #506), rate limit UX (#464, PR #505). All PRs merged to dev.
