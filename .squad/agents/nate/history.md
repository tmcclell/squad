# Nate — History

## Project Context
- **Project:** Squad — programmable multi-agent runtime for GitHub Copilot
- **Owner:** Brady
- **Stack:** TypeScript (strict, ESM), Node.js ≥20, Ink 6 (React for CLI), Vitest
- **CLI:** Ink-based interactive shell — must work in TTY and non-TTY modes
- **Key files:** packages/squad-cli/src/cli/shell/terminal.ts (capability detection)

## Learnings
- **2025-07-17 — Accessibility Audit (#328):** Performed full audit across keyboard nav, color/NO_COLOR, error guidance, and help text. Verdict: CONDITIONAL PASS. Key findings: (1) NO_COLOR env var not respected in terminal.ts or output.ts — ANSI codes emitted unconditionally; (2) Tab autocomplete module exists (autocomplete.ts) but is not wired into InputPrompt.tsx; (3) Three error messages lack remediation hints (missing team.md, charter not found, SDK not connected); (4) Welcome banner shows keyboard shortcuts but /help command does not repeat them. Color-as-meaning is partially mitigated by emoji + text labels. Report filed to .squad/decisions/inbox/nate-accessibility-audit.md.
- **2025-07-18 — Accessibility Hardening (#339):** Implemented full NO_COLOR compliance across all shell components. Added `isNoColor()` to terminal.ts; updated AgentPanel (static dot + `[Active]`/`[Error]` text labels), ThinkingIndicator (static `...` + `⏳` prefix, no color cycling), InputPrompt (static `[working...]`, bold cursor), MessageStream (color-gated labels), App (color-gated border). All animations degrade to static alternatives. Focus indicators use bold for monochrome visibility. Created `docs/accessibility.md` with keyboard shortcuts table, NO_COLOR behavior matrix, color contrast guidelines, and error message requirements. Build passes, 55/59 tests pass (4 pre-existing failures unrelated to this change).
- **2025-07-18 — Honest Quality Audit (Brady review):** Full re-audit of all shell components. Grade: **C+**. NO_COLOR foundation is solid but docs have multiple inaccuracies vs. code. See detailed findings below.
