### 2026-03-01: Nap engine — dual sync/async export pattern
**By:** Fenster (Core Dev)
**What:** The nap engine (`cli/core/nap.ts`) exports both `runNap` (async, for CLI entry) and `runNapSync` (sync, for REPL). All internal operations use sync fs calls. The async wrapper exists for CLI convention consistency.
**Why:** REPL `executeCommand` is synchronous and cannot await. ESM forbids `require()`. Exporting a sync variant keeps the REPL integration clean without changing the shell architecture.
**Impact:** Future commands that need both CLI and REPL support should follow this pattern if they only do sync fs work.
