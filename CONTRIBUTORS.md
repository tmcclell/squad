## Insider Program

**[INSIDER]** — Early access testers for Squad development builds.

The Insider Program gives you access to cutting-edge features before they ship. Insiders run development builds directly from the `insider` branch and help us catch bugs, validate UX, and shape the future of Squad.

### What It Is

- **Early access** to unreleased features
- **Development builds** with continuous updates
- **Direct input** on what gets built next
- **Experimental features** that may rough around the edges

### How to Join

Install from the insider branch using the honor system:

```bash
npx github:bradygaster/squad#insider
```

That's it. You're now on insider builds.

### What to Expect

- **Regular updates** — The insider branch receives commits as features ship
- **Experimental features** — Some features may not be fully stable
- **Bug reports welcome** — Help us find and fix issues early
- **Version format** — `v0.4.2-insider+{commit-hash}` in your `squad.agent.md`

### Report Issues

Found a bug in an insider build? Please [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/bradygaster/squad/issues) with:

- **Version** — The full version string from your `squad.agent.md`
- **What happened** — Clear description of the bug or unexpected behavior
- **Steps to reproduce** — How to trigger the issue
- **Environment** — CLI or VS Code, Node version, OS

Label your issue with `[INSIDER]` so we can track it.
